# CST370-HW3_1_Java

Write a Java program for hw3_1 that reads the number of input values from a user. Then, read the input values from the user. After that, your program should display them in the ascending order. When you display the numbers, you have to use a short representation if there are consecutive numbers. For example, if there are three numbers such as 51, 52, and 53 in the input values, you have to display them 51â€“53 to save space. For the assignment, you can assume that the input values are positive integers and unique (= No duplications in the input numbers).


Input format: This is a sample input from a user.

6
51
27
53
77
52
75

The first number (= 6 in the example) indicates that there will be 6 values in the input. Then, the following lines are the actual values. 

Sample Run 0: Assume that a user typed the following lines

6
51
27
53
77
52
75

This is the correct output.

27 51-53 75 77

Sample Run 1: Assume that a user typed the following lines

7
26
51
27
53
77
52
75

This is the correct output.

26-27 51-53 75 77


Sample Run 2: Assume that a user typed the following lines

10
4
5
6
1
2
3
7
9
10
11

This is the correct output.
